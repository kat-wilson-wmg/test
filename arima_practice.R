## presidents contains NAs

require(graphics)
(fit1 <- arima(presidents, c(1, 0, 0)))
nobs(fit1)
tsdiag(fit1)
(fit3 <- arima(presidents, c(3, 0, 0)))  # smaller AIC
tsdiag(fit3)
BIC(fit1, fit3)
## compare a whole set of models; BIC() would choose the smallest
AIC(fit1, arima(presidents, c(2,0,0)),
    arima(presidents, c(2,0,1)), # <- chosen (barely) by AIC
    fit3, arima(presidents, c(3,0,1)))

## An example of using the  'fixed'  argument:
## Note that the period of the seasonal component is taken to be
## frequency(presidents), i.e. 4.
(fitSfx <- arima(presidents, order=c(2,0,1), seasonal=c(1,0,0),
                 fixed=c(NA, NA, 0.5, -0.1, 50), transform.pars=FALSE))
## The partly-fixed & smaller model seems better (as we "knew too much"):
AIC(fitSfx, arima(presidents, order=c(2,0,1), seasonal=c(1,0,0)))


## An example of ARIMA forecasting:
